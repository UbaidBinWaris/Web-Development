        Education Testing Council (ETC) was setup by the Higher Education
        Commission of Pakistan (HEC) vide notification No. 19-54 HEC/HRM/14/584,
        dated 25th January 2017. Later, the Supreme Court of Pakistan directed
        the HEC in August 2018 to conduct assessment tests for admission into
        LLB degree programs and enrollment of law graduates with Pakistan Bar
        Council. Thus, recognizing the need for a state-of-the-art, independent,
        financially viable, transparent, and accountable testing service
        provider, the Commission approved the establishment of a revamped
        Education Testing Council (ETC) in its 34th meeting held on August
        30-31, 2018.
